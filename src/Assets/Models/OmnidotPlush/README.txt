The plot:

- Godot engine is not so ideal, as it seems.
- Redot engine may be worthly alternative, but I don't think, that I can make plush version of that engine without licensing issues (see Redot logo license).

I came to one idea: the forks, created after Godot scandal - are remaining the same Godot (and will remain, because they have one codebase. Even if it get changed, the most codebase will be common Godot).
So I designed a logo for all Godot forks, including the same Godot - The Omnidot!
And I made this model. Enjoy!

Maybe, if I gain more and more knowledge, this logo will be the logo on my own Godot/Redot fork!
